# 2. Use Rails with rspec

Date: 2024-04-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The client has requested Rails and that's what our team is best at.  Rails uses the minitest framework by default, but our team has more rspec experience.

## Decision

We're going to use Rails and rspec.

## Consequences

Unit tests will be faster and easier to write.
